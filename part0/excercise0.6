    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
    activate server
    server-->>browser: return status code of 201, which POST succeed, a message is also returned telling the browser that the "note {was} created"
    deactivate server

    No new GET requests are made instead, the callback function, or event listener the one
    on window.onload is activated. Which first prevents the submit button from working normally,
    instead it adds the note value to the notes array on the browser, it clears the notes input
    textbox, runs the redrawnotes functions and send/POST the note to the server
