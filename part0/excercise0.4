    Note right of browser: The browser starts executing the JavaScript code that fetches the JSON from the server

     browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: [{ "content": "HTML is easy", "date": "2023-1-1" }, ... ]
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser executes the callback function that renders the notes. It's worth noting that even though the POST request returned a 302 code the note still made it on the json. So the note was posted afterall.
